**Problem Statements:** In an e-commerce landscape where customer preferences, purchasing behavior, and efficient order fulfillment play crucial roles, your analytical prowess is vital. The task is to dissect these datasets to uncover patterns and insights that could revolutionize e-commerce strategies, improve customer engagement, and drive sales growth.

**Objectives:** Using Tableau's robust capabilities to craft a compelling narrative from the provided datasets. This task will encompass thorough data preparation, intelligent data modeling, and the skillful application of calculated fields and Tableau functions for sophisticated analysis. The ultimate aim is to construct an interactive and intuitive dashboard in Tableau that showcases your key discoveries, offering concise, actionable insights into the optimization of hotel operations and performance.

Key findings include the identification of high-value customer segments, top-performing products, and opportunities for customer retention. Seasonal trends and international market potential were also explored, providing a foundation for strategic decision-making.
